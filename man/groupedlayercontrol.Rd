\title{Leaflet layer control with support for grouping overlays together.
Also supports making groups exclusive (radio instead of checkbox).}
\usage{
addGroupedLayersControl(
  map,
  baseGroups = character(0),
  overlayGroups = character(0),
  position = c("topright", "bottomright", "bottomleft", "topleft"),
  options = leaflet::layersControlOptions(),
  data = getMapData(map)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{The map widget.}

\item{baseGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a group.
The user will be able to choose one base group (only) at a time. This is
most commonly used for mostly-opaque tile layers.}

\item{overlayGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a
group. The user can turn each overlay group on or off independently.}

\item{position}{position of control: "topleft", "topright", "bottomleft", or
"bottomright"}

\item{options}{a list of additional options, intended to be provided by
a call to \code{layersControlOptions}}

\item{data}{the data object from which the argument values are derived; by
default, it is the \code{data} object provided to \code{leaflet()}
initially, but can be overridden}
}

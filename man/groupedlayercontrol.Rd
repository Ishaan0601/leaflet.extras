\title{Leaflet layer control with support for grouping overlays together.
Also supports making groups exclusive (radio instead of checkbox).}
\usage{
addGroupedLayersControl(
  map,
  baseGroups = character(0),
  overlayGroups = character(0),
  position = c("topright", "bottomright", "bottomleft", "topleft"),
  options = groupedLayersControlOptions(),
  data = getMapData(map)
)

groupedLayersControlOptions(
  exclusiveGroups = NULL,
  groupCheckboxes = TRUE,
  collapsed = TRUE,
  autoZIndex = TRUE,
  ...
)

addGroupedOverlay(map, group, name, groupname)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{The map widget.}

\item{baseGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a group.
The user will be able to choose one base group (only) at a time. This is
most commonly used for mostly-opaque tile layers.}

\item{overlayGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a
group. The user can turn each overlay group on or off independently.}

\item{position}{position of control: "topleft", "topright", "bottomleft", or
"bottomright"}

\item{options}{a list of additional options, intended to be provided by
a call to \code{layersControlOptions}}

\item{data}{the data object from which the argument values are derived; by
default, it is the \code{data} object provided to \code{leaflet()}
initially, but can be overridden}

\item{exclusiveGroups}{character vector of layer groups to make exclusive (use radio buttons)}

\item{groupCheckboxes}{Show a checkbox next to non-exclusive group labels for toggling all}

\item{collapsed}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), the layers control will be
rendered as an icon that expands when hovered over. Set to \code{FALSE}
to have the layers control always appear in its expanded state.}

\item{autoZIndex}{if \code{TRUE}, the control will automatically maintain
the z-order of its various groups as overlays are switched on and off.}

\item{...}{other options for \code{layersControlOptions()}}

\item{group}{The groupname of the layer}

\item{name}{The name of the layer}
}
